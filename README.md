# The Codex Project: A Theory of Everything

> "Ambition is the gas; temperance is the oil." —G. "Cat" Evan Weller

The Codex Project is an open-access, modular, and ever-evolving encyclopedia of human knowledge — designed to educate, inspire, and endure.

Founded by **G. Evan Weller** (also known online as catlover013579, catlover135790, catlover13579, or simply Cat), this project seeks to collect, organize, and preserve humanity’s understanding of science, technology, philosophy, and culture in a format that is accessible, academically rigorous, and designed to last generations.

- **Subject** → collection of related papers
- **Technology (Tech)** → broader application areas
- **Field** → organized bodies of knowledge
- **Branch** → subdomains of science, philosophy, culture
- **Codex** → complete volumes on one knowledge root
- **The Codex Project** → the full library of everything
