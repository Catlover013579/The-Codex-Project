# The Codex Project: A Theory of Everything

> "Ambition is the gas; temperance is the oil." — Evan Weller

Founded by **G. Evan Weller** (also known online as catlover013579, catlover135790, or catlover13579), this project seeks to collect, organize, and preserve humanity’s understanding of science, technology, philosophy, and culture in a format that is accessible, academically rigorous, and designed to last generations.
