## 🔍 Purpose

The Codex Project is a generational archive of human knowledge. Academic integrity is the bedrock that ensures its truthfulness, usefulness, and legacy. This document outlines the standards expected of all contributors and maintainers to protect the Codex’s scholarly value.

## 🧠 Guiding Principles

1. **Honesty** — All work must reflect truthful research and proper attribution.
2. **Transparency** — Sources, methods, and changes must be clearly documented.
3. **Accountability** — Contributors and reviewers are responsible for maintaining these standards.
4. **Respect** — Ideas, identities, and disciplines are treated with intellectual and personal respect.
5. **Stewardship** — Contributions are made not just for now, but for the future.
